Its main purpose is for security testing, and data / information collecting. It is not made to cause harm, or to be used in malicious ways under any circumstances.
Its features include:
  	IP Toolkit
  	MaskPhish
  	ZPhisher
  	CamPhish
  	DDoS Attack Tests
  	Port Scanner (for DDoS)
  
What does the IP Toolkit do?
It allows the user to find the geolocation of an IP Address. It also shows your public and private IP address if needed. This tool is still under works, however these features that have been listed do work properly.

What des MaskPhish do?
It turns any link into a different link with a different name. for example, it can change links from one name to another, for example, you could make a link look like a ‘https://youtube.com’ or ‘https://google.com’ link. This tool is not intended to cause harm in any way, it is made to test internet security – useful for companies looking to test their networks.

What does ZPhisher do?
ZPhisher is a feature that allows the user to generate links that look like other websites i.e. phishing links, the purpose of these links is also for network security and to see whether the ISP’s network can detect these links. If these links are pressed on, it saves the IP to a file (ip.txt). Another feature is that if the link is pressed AND the user decides to input their information (Note: this generates a website that looks legitimate), it saves the information into another text file.

What does CamPhish do?
Like ZPhisher, it generates a link and finds the user’s IP when they press it, however, it has another feature in which it takes shots of the user’s front camera/ webcam.

What does a DDoS attack do?
DDoS attacks send packets to any IP, overwhelming them and causing the network on that IP to slow down or stop working. This is very useful when testing how networks take in packets.

What does a Port Scanner do?
A port scanner finds open ‘ports’ on an IP. You need to know the open ports for the DDoS attack, as you can only send packets towards open ports.

Future Incoming Features:
PhoneInfoga: Ability to find lots of information off any phone number – used to find and stop spam callers.
AndroRAT and iPhone RAT: Grabs SMS, Phone, Image, and text logs from iOS and android devices with ease. These features can be implemented in lots of ways.

Q: What do the options on CamPhish do?
A: Ngrok and Serveo are ways how the type of links is made. It doesn’t affect what it does, however option 1 is best. 
Q: How long do these links last?
A: These links normally stay active for 15 mins OR until the terminal window is closed.
Q: Can I open multiple instances of MZZZQ Client?
A: Yes, you can open multiple instances of MZZZQ Client. (Useful if you want to use one window to open CamPhish or ZPhisher, and another one with MaskPhish to mask these links.
